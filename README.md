# doorman-app-design

Welcome to the Doorman App Starter Project!

This is an open-source project aimed at helping beginners get started with development. The project is centered around the Doorman App app, which is a mobile app designed to help manage building deliveries, entrances and exits.

Our goal is to create a community-driven project where anyone can contribute and learn from each other. We started this project to help our neighbors who are interested in learning about software development. We believe that open-source projects like this one can be a great way for beginners to gain practical experience and build their portfolios.

The project is divided into several Git repositories, each with a specific focus. This first repository contains the Figma files with the screens prototypes of the Doorman App. We encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to the project to start by exploring this repository.

We welcome all contributions, no matter how big or small. If you're new to development, we encourage you to start by exploring the project and making small changes. As you gain confidence, you can take on more challenging tasks and start contributing more substantially.

Thank you for your interest in the Doorman App Starter Project, and we look forward to working with you!
